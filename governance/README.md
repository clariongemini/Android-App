# Executive Operating System (CEO V7)

Portable governance layer for **any** Android project bootstrapped from the Factory.

## Purpose

Enforce the chain:

**Decision → Delivery → Measurement → Learning**

Not reports. Not charters alone. **User-visible product.**

## Bootstrap

After `init-new-app.sh`:

```bash
./scripts/init-governance.sh
```

Or automatically — `init-new-app.sh` calls it.

When syncing into an existing project:

```bash
./scripts/sync-standards.sh /path/to/project
cd /path/to/project && ./scripts/init-governance.sh
```

## Repo vs runtime (what lives where)

| Artifact | In Factory Git repo | Per-project (init / runtime) |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Charters, README, protocols | ✅ `governance/**/DEPARTMENT_CHARTER.md` | Synced, then edited per project |
| Executive MD (CEO OS, audit chain) | ✅ `governance/executive/*.md` | Synced |
| Governance templates | ✅ `templates/governance/` | Copied by `init-governance.sh` |
| `SPRINT_LOCK.json` | ❌ gitignored | Generated per project |
| `APPROVAL_QUEUE.md` | ❌ gitignored | Generated per project |
| `roadmap_priorities.json` | ❌ gitignored | Generated per project |
| `project.config.json` | ❌ gitignored | Generated per project |
| Analytics output | ❌ gitignored | Device/Firebase kanıtı sonrası |
| `YAPILACAKLAR.md` | Template only | `init-yapilacaklar.sh` |

## Project config

`governance/project.config.json` — filled by init with app name, package, factory version.

Sprint lock slots P0–P4 are **project-specific** — edit after PDC first decisions.
